# traffic_light

###Introduction 
traffic is one of the most expensive and common external influences of the vehicle. In Israel drivers spend millions of hours of work and leisure a year in traffic jams, which harms social welfare, social capital and economy, at a cost of billions of shekels per year. The way it will be possible to reduce traffic is by designing a traffic light system which will be both stable and safe for cars and pedestrians and also for visually impaired people. Traffic lights are one of the important means for improving traffic flow and maintaining a safe and proper traffic regime.


###The purpose of this project

the purpose of this project is to design and implement a traffic light system for a T-junction as described in the following figure:

The junction consists of two arms a minor road connecting to the main road. The minor road includes a pedestrian crossing, where the junction include three traffic lights, working in sync as described in figure 2 (the pedestrians traffic light is coordinated with the secondary traffic light)

The system includes a countdown display for pedestrians and a beep at a frequency that changes according to the traffic light condition.


###The system requirements

•	The system switches between different modes with varying lengths of time
•	The system beeps at two different frequencies at pedestrian crossing to be used by visually impaired people
•	A time display which shows by counting down how much time a pedestrian has left to cross
•	The system should be synchronous 
•	Pedestrian priority button is installed in the system when the pedestrian adds an a additional 2 seconds for safe crossing 
•	The system will activate the button only when a new mode cycle begins
•	The system allows safe stopping of vehicles when switching between modes.


###The systems implementation

The system was implements using various software
•	Multisim
•	Board design
•	Arduino


###Summary 

This project, a safe and accessible traffic light junction. Was designed for the pedestrians in general and the visually impaired in particular.
The system was logically designed using Arduino controller. The implementation using Arduino technology is complex and mentally challenging work, and it showed when the circuits were summed up as one system.
